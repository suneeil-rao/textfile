Line 1:
A legend in her native Lisbon, Maria Severa Onofriana, known simply as Severa, is remembered as the voice 
that brought fado into popular culture.
By performing at taverns across the Alfama district, she helped spread this expressive style of music in the 1830s and 40s.

Often somber in tone, fado (which translates roughly to “fate”) is a lyrical ode to the trials of everyday life. 
Although Severa told many of these tales through her songs, very little is actually known about her life.

For that reason, the singer’s story has been reimagined many times in music, theater, and film.
Today’s Doodle is yet another take on the famous fadista. Donning her signature dark shawl, Severa plays 
the “Portuguese blues” as we celebrate her contributions to music on what would have been her 196th birthday.
